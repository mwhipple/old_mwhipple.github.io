Emacs has a rich set of built-in functionality but it also has a vast
ecosystem of easily installed packages of varying quality. I found
myself seduced into quickly installing packages that introduced
significant complexity without commensurate benefits over
built-in or simpler solutions (and introducing notable performance
issues). In reaction to this I've scrapped my previous emacs config and started
a [new one](https://github.com/mwhipple/mw-emacs) from scratch which
will be based on more careful and conservative tweaks.

The new config will serve to customize my emacs install and also
document provided behavior (such as standard key bindings) with
incremental commits (ideally more than once a day). Packages will be
included as they are assessed, but built-in functionality will be
explored first (working with emacs snapshots as the base). :chicken:
