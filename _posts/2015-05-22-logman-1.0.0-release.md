Release Information
---
LogMan 1.0.0 primarily represents the first version of the API/SPI for which backwards compatibility will be maintained (the very simple interfaces presently exposed). The main code has no significant difference from 0.1.1 but the 1.0.0 indicates proper release following [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). A binding for `log4j` has also been published in addition to the original `logback` binding.

Roadmap
---
LogMan has been satisfying the immediate needs so minimal further work is planned without reason.

A planned 1.1 release will include a Gradle plugin to allow for property based log system selection and timed reversion to the default logging level (i.e. to allow setting the log level to `DEBUG` for 30 seconds before restoring the original value).
