Welcome to the latest incarnation of my Web site.  Hopefully this is
one I'll finally actually keep up to date.  My last attempt used a
bunch of technologies were too far removed from what I was working with and not something I particularly wanted to spend time with and so it quickly fell into abandon.

This version is using GitHub Pages with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) so should be a good combination of simplicity, tools that I'm using on a regular basis and/or have interest in...and can be managed on my tablet which means that it can be worked on more readily in short windows of free time.

I'll be spending occasional scattered time trying to make this site look better & do cooler things, in addition to spending time adding content and organizing some content that is presently floating around elsewhere.
