The first official release of LogMan is now available for download
from Bintray or Maven Central.

What is LogMan?
---
LogMan is a facade for managing logging systems similar to the way
that slf4j is a facade for using logging systems. The management of
logging is more likely to need greater knowledge of the underlying
logging system but is also a much narrower need, so it should not be
expected that slf4j should provide this functionality. The narrowness
of the need would also explain the lack of an existing library (at
least as far as I know), but my reasons for starting this anyway are
outlined on the
[main GitHub page](https://github.com/mwhipple/logman).

There are other options to solve the same problem: the first approach
I went with was using reflection to eliminate any compile time dependencies and provide
a similar level of graceful failure. It was soon realized that the
amount of code needed for reflection would become unwieldly as the
provided functionality or number of supported logging
systems (which would be likely to deter my actually doing
the work). Scripting could also work very well but is obviously
further from the metal than raw Java. The separation of the API from
the binding in LogMan should allow for a sane minimal baseline which can also
handle any of the above approaches which could be used to provide more
dynamic behavior.

At the time of this writing the only binding available is for Logback,
so presently it provides a Hobson's choice functionality where it
works for Logback and won't break for other systems. The bindings
themselves are very simple so the present logback module serves as a
DIY template and I'll also be creating new ones: if I need them, if they
are requested, or if I feel like it. A log4j binding should be
available shortly.

What's Up With the Version Number?
---
0.1.1 is a bit of an unusual number for a first release but a quick
recap of the off the books history explains the version number...

### 0.0.x
The very first version of this library was number 0.0.1 and it started
with stealing large tracts of code from slf4j. This was a useful
academic exercise since slf4j uses some interesting techniques to
allow the appropriate implementation to be bound at runtime. It was
quickly realized however that the logic was far more than was needed
for this project as most of it revolves around allowing the slf4j
facade to be available immediately as the application is starting up
regardless of whether a binding has been loaded yet. Keeping the state
available and consistent is important for using logging, but far less
so for managing the logging system (where failure is far more of an
option) so this approach was considered too complicated.

### 0.1.0
The slf4j style initialization worked decently well but it was
recognized to be overly complicated and so occasional issues became
harder than necessary to diagnose, and so a simpler approach was desired.
Unfortunately the first adopted alternative was
_too_ simple in that it ended up not actually doing anything. I'd had
the misconception that static initialization of classes in Java was
done as the classes were loaded and had used approaches just different
enough in the past to reinforce this belief. The attempted approach was
therefore to allow each binding to register itself with the
`LogManFactory` and allow for a strictly directed path of knowledge
going one way to the core API module. The
[JLS](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.4)
(which is on my reading list, but pretty low on it) defines the actual
behavior as more or less requiring the class to be referenced, which
entirely destroys the possibility of the approach working without
introducing some explicit reference to the binding implementations and
polluting the whole design. 0.1.0 was released...but it doesn't work
unless you were to jam a reference in and make the system pointless.

### 0.1.1
The present release has a simple approach that actually works. The
static initialization approach not working pointed to needing some
kind of plugin system style mediator, so with the goal of keeping it
as simple and standard as possible `java.util.ServiceLoader` was
adopted and is working well.
