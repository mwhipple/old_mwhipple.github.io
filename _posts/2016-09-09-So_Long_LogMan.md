One of my GitHub projects lingering around is
[LogMan](https://github.com/mwhipple/logman): an interface for
management of logging systems which allowed for registration of
implementations at run time rather than design or build or time. It was
a fun, useful little project but was primarily the result of my
trying to solve cultural issues through code (the tool at my
disposal). Tools like JMX are far better positioned to provide that
type of functionality, and if there are constraints that block the
usability of such tools then that may be a symptom of deeper issues.

In light of that LogMan is now abandon-ware. On the off chance
someone finds it useful or interesting then it should be simple enough
to take over. :closed_book:
