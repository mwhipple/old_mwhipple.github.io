Maybe as an artifact of my age I've always considered a printer to be part of a complete computing environment, but much like cereal being part of a complete breakfast I've come to question that. Gone is the delight of watching an unbroken stream of tractor feed paper slowly buzzing and eagerly awaiting the tactile delight of attempting to remove the edges off of the stack before separating the individual pages. All that's left is a hangover of overpriced supplies and devices that seem oddly reluctant to apply pigment to paper.

I've been waiting for an inkjet I didn't end up hating; have toyed with the idea of springing for a color laser printer, but have finally realized that maybe all those thoughts were just infections from the 1990's.

Part of the problem may be that that I print very rarely. In the past I've printed infrequently enough that the first step in the process would be my figuring out which random printer I had sitting around was most likely to work.  That eventually settled into having a stable printer that was most likely connected...but whether it had supplies or the computer it was connected to knew of its existence remained a mystery. A couple years ago I figured printers would have to be cooler by now so I picked up an Epson WF-3640 for my wife and myself. It has wireless networking and comparitively cheap cartridges with individual colors.  I was feeling optimistic...but of course I went to print for the first time in a while a couple weeks ago and it came out looking smudgy and horrible. Then...my wife needed to print something and it obstinately refused to print her black and white draft quality document because it was out of magenta ink. :rage1:

For the smudginess issue I did the usual cleaning/alignment shuffle and got the point where replacing the cartridge would be the next step and then had an overdue epiphany: for my needs having a printer makes no sense. Going somewhere that offers printing and paying them a couple bucks a couple times a year would take a _long_ time to add up to the cost of a printer and would neatly avoid associated frustrations.  In my foolish past I've generally had ink jet printers which would often require a new cartridge upon use which would then often become dried up or otherwise unusable in between periods of printing. Especially now that there are more options to do digitally what previously required hard copies the cost of ink alone doesn't seem to be economical, let alone the paper and printer...not to mention what a nuiscance it can be to find a physical location for all the stuff to keep it primed for its annual chance to disappoint.

But...I can run out to print things or do it when I'm at the office a lot more easily than my toddler-watching wife so I did end up picking up a cheap B/W laser printer and will probably explore options for getting the multi-purpose inkjet to be more valuable than it's present role as an obnoxiously large scanner. :disappointed_relieved:
