  <p>This post is mostly regurgitating readily available information:
    mostly for my future reference and I may do something more
    interesting with it in the future.
  <p>As part of working on this Web site I'm working on organizing my
    pictures a bit, which is something for which I've never found a solution
    that I particularly like (though I haven't looked too hard). Most
    photo organizing software that I've tried has seemed too needy; I'm not
    looking for the kind of commitment where I cede control of the
    underlying storage or have to devote more than a couple seconds at
    a time.</p>
  <p>My usual workflow and the above constraints lead me to the
    command line, and the command line has the excellent de facto
    standard suite of utilities
    <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>.
    Additional metadata from
    a photo file can be listed using <code>identify --verbose filename</code>,
    which can be used to belatedly tag or rename image files and
    <code>convert</code> can be used to quickly modify an image for uses
    such as sticking on a Web site. The photo on this page was
    prepared from my photo library with:
    <pre>
      convert 20140614_Bay_Bridge.jpg --resize 8% --rotate 90 bay-bridge.jpg
    </pre>
    A huge perk for me of preferring ImageMagick commands over using a
    graphics editor is that source files are likely to be consistent
    dimensions (whatever the camera uses) are the desired renditions
    (to fit a Web page format) so once the percentage(s) are worked
    out resizing images is totally painless. I can't say the same for
    cropping or any other manipulations, but hopefully my laziness can
    keep from having to cross that bridge for a while.</p>
  <p>All the ImageMagick goodness is covered in the man pages and
    (presumably) on the  <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">site</a>.

  <p>I'm launching a new Web site/blog for some of my work (yay!). It's
    not much to look at the moment but I'll be incrementally improving
    the design so it will probably be pretty snazzy by the time I
    retire or so.</p>
  <p>I'm turning my attention back to attempting to blog because I
    find that I mostly interact with the Internet in a way that aligns
    with static'ish Web sites and blogging: preferring more unidirectional
    asynchronous batching rather than the generally more high touch
    social media model (in which I tend to participate just sporadically
    enough to eke out something resembling an existence).
    The more asynchronous, on-demand nature of Web sites also aligns with
    at least one of the biases asserted in Douglas Rushkoff's
    <a href="http://www.rushkoff.com/books/program-or-be-programmed/">
      <cite>Program or Be Programmed</cite></a></p>
  <p>I plan to write a short blog entry every week covering some
    technical topic which may or may not be of much use to anyone
    other than me, in addition to jazzing up the site in some way or
    another as part of the same commit. Each post will also contain a
    picture, hopefully in some way related to the post but probably
    not...but either way it will help me conquer my aversion of adding
    images to Web sites and spur me to organize some of my photos.</p>
