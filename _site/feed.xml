        <title>Welcome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the latest incarnation of my Web site.  Hopefully this is
one I’ll finally actually keep up to date.  My last attempt used a
bunch of technologies were too far removed from what I was working with and not something I particularly wanted to spend time with and so it quickly fell into abandon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version is using GitHub Pages with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; so should be a good combination of simplicity, tools that I’m using on a regular basis and/or have interest in…and can be managed on my tablet which means that it can be worked on more readily in short windows of free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be spending occasional scattered time trying to make this site look better &amp;amp; do cooler things, in addition to spending time adding content and organizing some content that is presently floating around elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
